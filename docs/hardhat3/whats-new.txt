[40]#What's new in Hardhat 3

   Hardhat 3 comes with many new features and improvements. Most of these
   changes are backwards-compatible or easy to adapt to existing projects.

[41]#Support for Solidity Tests

   Hardhat 3 comes with Foundry-compatible Solidity tests, which are fast
   and ideal for unit testing, and also work great for fuzz and invariant
   tests. Writing integration tests in TypeScript is still supported and
   can be used alongside Solidity tests.

   Learn more in [42]our Solidity tests guide.

[43]#Multichain support

   Hardhat 2's development network always behaves like Ethereum Mainnet.
   Hardhat 3 removes this limitation, letting you choose which kind of
   chain you want to simulate. And, unlike Hardhat 2, you can configure
   multiple simulated networks, each with its own chain type.

   The initial release includes first-class support for Ethereum Mainnet
   and OP Mainnet, and we'll gradually add new chain types over time. In
   the meantime, a generic chain type can be used as a fallback for
   networks that are not yet supported. This generic chain type behaves
   the same as Hardhat Network in Hardhat 2 and works with all of Hardhat
   3's new features.

[44]#ESM-first

   Hardhat 3 embraces modern JavaScript by using [45]ECMAScript Modules
   (ESM) by default. Configuration files must now use ESM, although
   CommonJS (CJS) modules are still supported in scripts and tests.

[46]#Network manager

   A Hardhat 2 task has access to a single, fixed connection for its
   entire duration. In Hardhat 3, connections are managed explicitly, and
   tasks can create and use multiple connections simultaneously.

[47]#Test Runner Plugins

   In Hardhat 2, JavaScript tests are always run with a bundled version of
   Mocha. In Hardhat 3, the test runner is just another plugin and you can
   choose which one to use. We have official plugins for Mocha and for
   [48]Node.js's built-in test runner. The recommended option is the
   Node.js test runner, because it's fast and has no external
   dependencies.

[49]#Built-in Solidity code coverage

   Hardhat 3 comes with built-in Solidity code coverage, which works out
   of the box both in Solidity and TypeScript tests. All you need to do is
   run your tests with --coverage.

[50]#Declarative Configuration

   Hardhat 3 configuration is now fully declarative. This contrasts with
   Hardhat 2, where part of the configuration came from the side effects
   of importing plugins or calling configuration functions like task.

[51]#Configuration Variables

   Hardhat 3 has support for Configuration Variables: values of the config
   that will only be loaded when needed. A similar feature already exists
   in Hardhat 2, but Hardhat 3's configuration variables are lazy and
   extensible.

   By default, their values are loaded from environment variables, but
   this behavior can be customized by plugins. Hardhat 3 comes with an
   official plugin that lets you store them encrypted on disk.

[52]#Build profiles

   Hardhat 3 introduces support for build profiles, which let you define
   different compilation settings for different workflows.

[53]#Full npm support

   Anything that can be done with npm is now supported by the build system
   of Hardhat 3. In most cases, this won't affect you, but advanced
   scenarios that were difficult or impossible now work out of the box.

[54]#New plugin system

   Hardhat 3 comes with a new hook system that enables easy extension of
   core functionality and allows plugin authors to add their own
   extensibility points.

[55]#Typed artifacts

   Hardhat 3 generates TypeScript declarations to have typed artifacts by
   default. These artifacts can be used by plugins to derive contract type
   information without a code generation step.

[56]#Programmatic initialization of the Hardhat Runtime Environment

   Apart from accessing a global instance of the Hardhat Runtime
   Environment by importing it from the hardhat module, you can now
   initialize multiple independent instances of the HRE programmatically.
