[40]#Getting help

   Hardhat has a strong community of users willing to help you in times of
   trouble. Please read this entire guide to learn where and how to ask
   for help more effectively.

   The first place to look for answers is the [41]GitHub Discussions
   section in the Hardhat repository. We recommend you search there first,
   as the answer may already exist.

   If you can't find what you are looking for on GitHub Discussions, you
   can [42]create a new Discussion.

   If you didn't have any luck on GitHub, or if you prefer a real-time
   chat, you can join our [43]Discord Server. Please read its rules and
   ask for help in the right channel.

[44]#Asking an effective question

   To increase the chances of getting an answer quickly on GitHub
   Discussions and Discord, you need to make sure you write a good
   question first. To do so, you need to include:
    1. A clear description of what you are trying to do.
    2. The results you are getting, and how they differ from what you
       expect.
    3. Which version of Hardhat you are running, and which plugins and
       their versions you are using.
    4. Very specific and concise instructions on how to reproduce your
       problem. Ideally, provide a [45]minimal reproducible example.
       Another good option is to provide a link to a public repository
       that provides an easy environment to reproduce the problem.

[46]#Reporting a bug

   If you think you've found a bug in Hardhat, please [47]report it.

   However, before reporting a bug, please follow these steps to ensure
   that a new bug report is actually warranted:
    1. Make sure you are using the latest version of Hardhat and its
       plugins. Your problem may already be fixed.
    2. Try to determine whether the issue is coming from a plugin by
       running your project with some of them disabled. We only accept bug
       reports for plugins published by us, all of which start with
       @nomicfoundation/. If you find an issue with a plugin published by
       someone else, you may be able to raise it with that publisher.
    3. Use the search on GitHub to try to find other reports of the same
       problem. If you find one, please comment on the existing issue
       instead of creating a new one.

   Whenever reporting a bug, and ideally whenever commenting on an
   existing Issue, please include all the information described in
   [48]Asking an effective question. By providing as much information as
   possible, you greatly increase the chances of your problem getting
   fixed quickly.
