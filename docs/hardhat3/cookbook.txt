[40]#Hardhat 3 Cookbook

   This section contains a collection of recipes for common tasks.

   We encourage you to contribute your own recipes to this section, by
   submitting a pull request to this [41]document.

[42]#Using Hardhat 3 with a proxy server

   Hardhat supports the http_proxy environment variable. When this
   variable is set, Hardhat will send its requests through the given proxy
   for things like JSON-RPC requests, mainnet forking and downloading
   compilers.

   There's also support for the no_proxy variable, which accepts a comma
   separated list of hosts or "*". Any host included in this list will not
   be proxied. Note that requests to "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" are never
   proxied.
