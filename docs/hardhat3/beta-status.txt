[40]#Hardhat 3: beta status

   Hardhat 3 is production-ready and you can migrate today!

   We'll keep it in beta status as we work on missing features and
   stabilize it in the near future.

[41]#Migration readiness

   We don't expect any major user-facing breaking change in the API, so we
   encourage projects to migrate to Hardhat 3.

   Take a look at the [42]migration guide to see how to do it.

[43]#Work in progress features

   There are some features that are still in development, and should be
   released soon:
     * Ledger support: We are working on porting over the
       @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ledger plugin, and should be available
       soon.
     * Gas reporting: Hardhat 3 will have a built-in alternative for the
       [44]hardhat-gas-reporter plugin, which will work with Solidity and
       Typescript tests.
     * Gas snapshots: The ability to take gas snapshots and compare them
       is still under development.
     * hardhat-deploy support: We are working on porting over the
       [45]hardhat-deploy plugin to Hardhat 3.

[46]#Migration blockers

   If your migration is blocked by a missing feature or plugin, please let
   us know [47]in this issue.

[48]#Plugin APIs

   The plugin APIs are still in beta status, and we may release small
   breaking changes in the future. If you are developing a plugin, please
   keep this in mind, and get in touch with us if you have any questions.
