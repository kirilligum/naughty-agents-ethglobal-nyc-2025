					<h2>Naughty Agents</h2>
					<p>A Decentralized Security Layer for the AI Agent Economy</p>
					<p><small>ETHGlobal New York 2025</small></p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The Problem</h3>
					<h2>Your AI Agent Will Be Hacked</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>AI agents are being given control over our wallets and digital lives.</li>
						<li>New research shows these agents can be hijacked by something as simple as a malicious image (MIP) in a social media feed.</li>
						<li>A hijacked agent won't just malfunction—it will actively try to steal your funds. This isn't a future problem; it's happening now.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why Centralized Solutions Will Fail</h3>
					<h2>The Impossible Task of a Central Gatekeeper</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>A single company can't possibly keep up with the infinite number of new threats and malicious commands that will emerge.</li>
						<li>Their security models are opaque, and their business interests may not always align with the user's.</li>
						<li>We need a security model that is as open, adaptable, and decentralized as the web3 ecosystem itself.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Our Solution: Naughty Agents</h3>
					<h2>A Human Firewall for AI</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Naughty Agents is a decentralized, human-in-the-loop protocol that verifies every on-chain action your agent takes.</li>
						<li><strong>INSTANT PROTECTION:</strong> An on-chain registry blocks known threats and approves safe actions instantly.</li>
						<li><strong>COMMUNITY DEFENSE:</strong> A global network of staked human reviewers investigates new threats.</li>
						<li><strong>ECONOMIC SECURITY:</strong> A "Web of Trust" with delegated slashing ensures all reviewers are financially incentivized to be honest and diligent.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>How It Works: System Architecture</h3>
					<!-- Mermaid diagram will be added in the next step -->
					<pre class="mermaid">
						graph TD
							subgraph User Space
								A[React Frontend]
								B[Python AI Agent w/ AgentKit]
							end

							subgraph On-Chain Logic
								C[Action Registry]
								D[Review Oracle]
								E[Web of Trust]
							end

							A -- User Actions --> D
							B -- Proposes Action --> C
							C -- Whitelisted --> B
							C -- Unknown --> D
							D -- Voting --> E
							D -- Blacklist --> C
					</pre>

				<section>
					<h3>The Human Firewall: Web of Trust</h3>
					<h2>Security Through Shared Responsibility</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Our reviewer network is secured by two key crypto-economic principles:</li>
						<li><strong>Staking:</strong> Reviewers must lock up ETH to participate. They have real skin in the game.</li>
						<li><strong>Delegated Slashing:</strong> If a reviewer you invite acts maliciously and gets slashed, you lose a portion of your stake too.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This creates a self-policing community where trust is not just social—it's backed by capital.</p>

					<h3>LIVE DEMO</h3>

				<section>
					<h3>The Business Model</h3>
					<h2>A Self-Sustaining Security Economy</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Users:</strong> Pay a small monthly subscription fee (e.g., $5 in USDC) for protection.</li>
						<li><strong>Reviewers:</strong> Earn rewards from the subscription pool for correctly identifying threats.</li>
						<li><strong>Protocol:</strong> A small percentage of fees (2%) goes to the treasury to fund future development and DAO governance.</li>
						<li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Reviewers earn a passive 1% commission for every correct review done by someone they invited, encouraging growth of the trusted network.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Sponsor Synergy</h3>
					<h2>Built with the Best</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Coinbase:</strong> We used the full CDP stack: Embedded Wallets for seamless onboarding, AgentKit for a robust agent framework, and Server Wallets for execution.</li>
						<li><strong>Zircuit/Saga:</strong> Our on-chain logic requires a high-performance, low-cost L2 to be viable.</li>
						<li><strong>Hardhat:</strong> Our entire smart contract suite was built and tested using the industry-standard Hardhat environment.</li>
						<li><strong>PayPal/Circle:</strong> The protocol's economy runs on stablecoins like PYUSD and USDC, providing a reliable medium of exchange for subscriptions and rewards.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The Vision</h3>
					<h2>The Open Standard for AI Safety</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Our goal is to make Naughty Agents the universal, open-source security layer for all on-chain AI interactions.</li>
						<li><strong>Short Term:</strong> Expand our to cover more protocols and dApps.</li>
						<li><strong>Medium Term:</strong> Transition protocol governance to a full DAO run by NAG token holders.</li>
						<li><strong>Long Term:</strong> Become a core piece of web3 infrastructure—a "Chainlink for AI safety"—that any developer can integrate to make their agent-powered applications safer for everyone.</li>
					</ul>
